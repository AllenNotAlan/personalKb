## Content

## Outcome
Successfully implemented a system that automates retrospectives after every AI task.

## Key Patterns
- Embedded mandatory directives in '.agents/instructions.md' to force AI self-reflection.
- Created a PowerShell sidecar script ('Invoke-Retrospective.ps1') to give the AI consistent historical context.

## Learning
Systematizing the 'End of Task' flow is more reliable than relying on manual user triggers.
